Documentation for the REST API
============================================

The following are the primary endpoints that we have as of now:
        - Users
        - MailingLists
        - Memberships
        - Domains
        - Emails

Collections should be paginated.

Each "ListView", instead of containing /all/ information about an item, should only contain partial
information, along with a URL that to the DetailView. The DetailView will return a more completely detailed
response.

List of things that can be queried via the API.

        2. Detail view of a user.

                c) user_id
                d) Membership to a mailing list. (Return all users who are subscribed to the List foo@bar.com)
                   which essentially is `[i.user for i in mlist.all_subscribers]`.
