Mailman-REST
============

This application was part of the work done by me as part of [Google Summer of Code 2013](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013) for [Mailman 3](http://wiki.list.org/display/DEV/Mailman+3.0) under the [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf/)

This code is hosted here for Archival purpose. Most of it is based entirely on very specific requirements for Mailman 3.

The requirements for running this application are:

1. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
2. [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
3. Postorius - A Django app that aims to provide an admin interface for Mailman.
4. Mailman 3 - Also referred as Mailman Core throughout the code and documentation.


Documentation
=============

Detailed documentation can be found at `mm-rest/website/public_rest/doc/`. It explains the overall design process behind the API, and also contains an API spec. The spec might not be up to date!
